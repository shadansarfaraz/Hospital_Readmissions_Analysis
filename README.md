# 🏥 Healthcare Readmission Risk Analytics
Macro-Based Advanced Excel Dashboard | Healthcare • Readmissions • Risk Analysis

## 📌 Overview
A **macro-driven Advanced Excel dashboard** built on **25,000 patient records** to analyze **hospital readmissions, patient risk categories, length of stay, and diagnosis trends**.

The dashboard uses **Excel VBA macros** to enable interactive filtering, highlighting of high-risk patients, and real-time KPI refresh for fast, decision-ready insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Track hospital readmission performance
- Identify **high-risk patient segments**
- Analyze readmissions by **risk level, age group, diagnosis, and specialty**
- Support data-driven discharge planning and care prioritization

## ⭐ STAR Method Breakdown

### **S — Situation**
Healthcare teams lacked a fast and interactive system to:
- Identify **high-risk patients prone to readmission**
- Analyze readmissions across risk levels, age groups, and diagnoses
- Manually track KPIs across large patient datasets

### **T — Task**
Design a **single-page, macro-enabled Excel dashboard** that:
- Tracks core readmission KPIs
- Segments patients by **risk category and age group**
- Highlights **high-risk patients automatically**
- Allows one-click dashboard refresh using VBA

### **A — Action**
- Cleaned and structured **25,000 healthcare records** in Excel
- Built KPI cards for:
  - Total Patients
  - Total Readmissions
  - Average Length of Stay
  - High-Risk Patient Count
- Developed **VBA macros** to:
  - Refresh dashboard data dynamically
  - Highlight high-risk patients using conditional logic
  - Enable button-based interactions (Refresh / High-Risk Highlight)
- Designed Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for:
  - Readmissions by Risk Category
  - High-Risk vs Readmitted comparison
  - Readmissions by Primary Diagnosis
  - Readmissions by Medical Specialty
- Implemented slicers for **age group, risk level, diagnosis, and specialty**

### **R — Result**
- Analyzed **25,000 patients** with **11,754 readmissions**
- Identified **3,328 high-risk patients** for targeted care planning
- Determined an **average length of stay of 4.5 days**
- Revealed **Medium-risk patients** as the largest contributor to readmissions (**13,118 cases**)
- Enabled faster decision-making through **one-click macro refresh and risk highlighting**
